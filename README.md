## 🎯 Project Overview

A next-generation, fully autonomous data engineering platform that eliminates manual data pipeline creation through advanced AI and machine learning. This platform automatically ingests, classifies, transforms, and delivers analytics-ready Data Vault 2.0 models without human intervention.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Driven Data Classification**: Automatic detection of data types, PII, and business keys
- **🏗️ Zero-Code Data Vault 2.0**: Automated hub, link, and satellite generation
- **🔮 Self-Learning Architecture**: Continuous adaptation to new data structures
- **💬 Conversational Interface**: Natural language pipeline creation and management
- **🔄 Self-Healing Pipelines**: Automatic error detection and recovery
- **⚡ Real-Time Processing**: Sub-minute latency for streaming and batch data
- **🛡️ Advanced Compliance**: Automated GDPR/CCPA compliance monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Powered-Automated-Data-Pipeline.git
cd AI-Powered-Automated-Data-Pipeline
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Generate sample data**
```bash
python generate_sample_data.py
```

5. **Run the pipeline**
```bash
python -m src.ai_pipeline.main
```

## 📊 Sample Data

The project includes comprehensive sample datasets for testing:

| Dataset | Records | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Customers | 1,000 | Customer demographics and business attributes |
| Products | 200 | Product catalog with pricing and inventory |
| Employees | 200 | Staff records with hierarchical relationships |
| Orders | 5,000 | Transaction records linking all entities |
| Transactions | 5,000 | Financial records with payment processing |

**Total: 11,400 records** across 47 columns with realistic business relationships.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/ai_pipeline

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/test_classification.py
```
